# Toast-Master-Timer
This is an application that can be used in a Toast Masters Club.  
It has timers for three different kinds of speeches:  
* Speech
* Table Topic
* Evaluation 

The user will enter the names of today's speakers. Then select the next speaker from the list, choose the type of speech, and then start the timer.  
The background color of the appliation will change from green to yellow to red depending on the amount of time spent by a speaker. Green means an appropriate amount of time has passed. Yellow is a warning. Red means the speaker has gone over time.  

Once the timer is stopped, the background color will reset, and the color will be recorded in the list of speakers.
